# AirNotifier Moodle Plugin Firebase API

A replacement API for https://github.com/airnotifier/airnotifier/[AirNotifier] server for the _AirNotifier Moodle Plugin_ that connects directly to _Firebase_. This was made since newer versions of _AirNotifier_ seems to be not working with the _Moodle Plugin_ due to usage of old apis. This server implements all needed endpoints and acts as a middleware between _Moodle AirNotifier Plugin_ and _Firebase_.

## Installation

This server uses https://nodejs.org/en/[_NodeJS_] instead of _Python_ (Used by _AirNotifier_). Be sure to have _NodeJS_ version >= 10 installed.

- `$ git clone https://github.com/NinjasCL/airnotifier-moodle-plugin-firebase-api`.
- `$ cd airnotifier-moodle-plugin-firebase-api`.
- `$ npm install`.
- `$ npm install -g forever`.

Also install https://firebase.google.com/docs/libraries[Firebase SDK] to your platform in order to obtain _FCM Token_.

## Configure

You would need to get the `json` configuration from your https://console.firebase.google.com[firebase console].

Also the headers `X-An-App-Key` and `X-An-App-Name` should be set in both server config and moodle plugin settings. Is recommended a random value using `npm run uuid` script for `X-An-App-Key`.

Be sure to set the correct server address and port in your _Moodle Plugin Settings_. (Beware of trailing slashes in the server address).

Check that you can interact with the server. The root endpoint should return a json with the version number.

## Usage

- Start the server with `npm start`.
- Send `FCM Token`. Not the native token.

- You can also use `npm run forever` to init a background process.

### Example token registration

This is how you can send from your _Firebase SDK_ instance to your _Moodle_ server.
You have to send the _FCM Token_ in the _pushid_ param.

Note: Contains Invalid token values for security purposes.
